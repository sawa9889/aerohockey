# Aerohockey

Multiplayer aerohockey game for 2 players on LOVE2D. Made mainly to test networking.

Features:
- Seamless netplay with rollback netcode
- Replays can be saved
- Multiple spectators can join and watch active game

To play, you would need a dedicated IP and port-forwarding, or to be in a local network. No singleplayer mode with bots unfortunately.
