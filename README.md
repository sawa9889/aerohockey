# platformer-framework

This is a platformer engine for LOVE. So we don't have to invent the wheel during the jam.

It should be modular - you should be able to plug any of the components without others. It shouldn't depend on everything else.

Examples are using assets from our previous game: https://saviorium.itch.io/colorless

Used "Barroom Ballet" by Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) as a music example.
